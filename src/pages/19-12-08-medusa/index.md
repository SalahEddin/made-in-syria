"...and if you _truly_ ask me, then I wouldn't be surprised" _spells slowly while sucking on his dying joint._


– Are you even listening? You must be very high Ioannis! I'm telling you that she has slept with that douche and your consolation reaction is not to be surprised?!


– You were her Medusa.


– "..."


– You tried to turn her into a stone, and it didn't work thankfully for either of you.

– YES! I am a very lucky guy whose wife has been cheating on him for god-knows-how-long. Pass me that joint.

– Here you go. I think you definitely earned it

– How was coming to you a good idea?

– "..."

– How come I'm Medusa in all of this? please explain.

– I'll answer your question, but first answer me this: what was your biggest takeaway since we left uni?

– Rhetorical I guess...

– Yes George _mou_, it indeed is, the lesson I learned hanging out with the club of scouts wannabes is that harm comes in many shapes and forms, and the most dangerous one, is the seemingly harmless ones, the ones that seem to be at worst-case scenario: neutral. Now to get back to your question _file_; Medusa did what many of us do on a daily basis, we sabotage our loved ones to guarantee that we freeze the moment of love we first lived together with them.

– _Panayiamou!_ where do you come up with all this, I thought you were an accountant, not a philosopher.

– Tonight I am a philosopher, the moon is full _file_.

– Still doesn't justify you calling me Medusa.

– Didn't you ask her not to take the promotion since it implied moving somewhere else? or that time you almost made a scene when she ordered the frog legs at the French restaurant, remember?

– So she cheated because I stopped her from trying frog legs?

– Pretty much

– Great

– This will pass

– Then what?

– Then you can find someone whom you won't turn into a stone. Medusa might've turned many men into statues, but her behaviour isn't scalable; she would've at worst case withheld herself from transforming the last non-statued man in Greece, despite the fact that he might've been a worse man than the men who were turned into stones.

– _Fita_ will then come back after realising that.

– I mean __you're__ the one who's going to attempt to turn many women into stone if you don't change your behaviour

– ...

Ioannis didn't waste anytime during the conversation and had already rolled another joint, the high-pitch tired repeating frictionful lighter sound was now being interrupted by George: "I definitely think your weed is your Medusa"

– My Medusa is god-awful, but not all stoned-men wish to turn back

– Very funny.
