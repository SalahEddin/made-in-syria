Do you have this feeling when waiting with a friend on the terminal for a bus or a plane to arrive, and your inner thoughts are wishing that bus would be 5 minutes late so you can have a bit more fun before saying goodbyes? Even stronger with a lover, this 5 more minutes wish can extend to a much much longer period… and you end up questioning your decision that led to this, maybe asking that person to move with you, or even more!

I thought of this feeling and how much it reminds me of my morning everyday; it's time to get up, your alarm is ringing and the sun is sneaking through your window, but you want to resist that rational conclusion of getting up and instead enjoy staying in bed for a bit longer. When you do it, you don't feel bad per se, but rather silly "I really didn't need more sleep, I should've gotten up earlier".

When contrasting those two feelings I can't help but feel contradiction in me; the spontaneous romantic with whom many proudly identify with, and the disciplined side that views it as lazy and bad behaviour.
Now I can't have this unsettling feeling without settling on a choice; one possibility is that the disciplined perspective is really silly and we should just fight it and move on, but so should we with the first behaviour. Keep those silly urges and to yourself as it appears that you require more discipline, and enjoy the ride while it lasted, this surely seems the mature thing to do, at least it does to the immature me…

The other possibility is that since our actions in the grand scheme of things are meaningless, what we choose to give value in our lives is what should matter, even if our first instinct is to ignore it or discard it as "silly" or "lazy". In that case giving yourself those extra five minutes are not about being lazy and staying comfy, but rather re-affirming that your spur-of-the-moment decisions are part of your flawed self and that you acknowledge them.

I am currently a fan of the second school; I'll be jealous of people doing it, and might opt for a terminal proposal one day, but for now, I'll enjoy my 5 more minutes…
