Being an angry leftist  at the system for a while you learn many ways to deal with that,one of those to be unphased by it and contain your problem into chewable honest lives.
Being born into a civil society rains on you with invisible expectations and also chains. Comfort is that chain and you know it,it's not bad, its not good, it's just that sound frequency you can no longer hear because you're getting older.
That sense of urgency that makes you feel that you should do something, not because of expectations, we wrote about that  in the 50s, but because of an inner sound; no. not motivation; we also wrote about that in the 90s and we've been milking the 'you you should be' since. I am talking about that metadriver that understands the expectations and the pressure and the inner moral compass with all its dilemma but still instinctively gets excited.
To grow that side, I now want to dance. 
It's important to remember we are animals in the wake of the `service` era; you can release your desires with sex and food, but the inner animals still wants to show off.
