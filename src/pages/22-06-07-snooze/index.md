I hate, I hate, I hate…
I adore that I can finally hate…
I love that I'm not calm, I hate that I can't rival time.
I hate to be put in socio-scale, tense over-compensator or an alien will prevail.
I detest spotlight honesty, I hate that my naive stage rolls credits.
I hate homing pigeons that leave faster than they arrive, I hate licking my heart for a postcard.
I hate unrolling each response, and get a smaller fire that barely chars its words.
Reject the response, wish that effort has a button to undo.
Quicksands can't sink a full human in reality, but in my film I drown.
I hate that your sandstorm can't be divided, I hate when it destroys only other towns.
I hate when the stew tells the cook to take his time.
I hate these shackles, pulling me into a mouldy rotten sea, not where I come from, but have to be.
A bit by bit, draining life to gain one.
I will get high again on cutting ocean's veins.
I hate that I adore to love ugliness.
I hate that the sea I hate, I actually love.
This hate moves mountains, I swear by it.
A film negative, stands undeveloped.
