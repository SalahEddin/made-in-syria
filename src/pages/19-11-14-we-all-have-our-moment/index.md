> The general principle of superposition of quantum mechanics applies to the states [that are theoretically possible without mutual interference or contradiction] ... of any one dynamical system. It requires us to assume that between these states there exist peculiar relationships such that whenever the system is definitely in one state we can consider it as being partly in each of two or more other states.  - Paul Dirac

Â 
What this means is that an object (particles, etc.) can be at two contradicting states at the same time and only picks one state when we try to observe it; for example the light can be a particle AND a wave at the same time, implying it has mass and no mass simultaneously, and only picks one of those two states when we try to observe it.


If we expand this definition slightly to include human beings, things can get refreshing; if we can consider that our personality is made of multiple traits, and these traits are the units that builds the dynamic system that is our personality, and we are an interactive part of this world where quantum physics apply, then we can conclude that the quantum superposition principle applies to us too.

Â 
I ask for bit of suspension of your argument, this is just a perspective piece after all. Moving from modernism to post-modernism many of us rejected the idea of black and white or bad vs evil for a more ambiguous world, where many things can be different shades of gray, furthermore as more time passes we start to accept the idea that no one person is constantly at a constant shade of gray, but rather can rubber-band between a range of shades of gray. This inconsistency can be thought of as a value for the trait of that person that their trait is taking when observed, and as in quantum theory, one observation is not enough and only when multiple observations have been recorded that you can strive towards the truth. An example can demonstrate this thought better: think of someone who is in multiple situations that requires them to be courageous or cowards, in some of these situations that person is a coward, and in some they make the courageous choice, let's say in 10 situation the person was a coward for 6 times while being courageous 4 times. So we can say that his courage superposition tended to collapse to courageous 80% of the times we observed it and 20% coward.

Â 
Unfortunately compared to light and qubits, we human are slow in our traits to be visible though our actions. So what good can this perspective bring us if we cannot have that many observations? I propose that it can be a perspective that makes us more human to ourselves and each other. I think the most obvious lesson is to go against every instinct that tells us to create an image from the first impression when we first encounter someone, where that person is in a situation that requires them to make (read: collapsed to) a choice, as this trait they demonstrated could've been a a very small probability from their trait, and that their probability of displaying a trait we agree with has a higher probability of happening, they just weren't "lucky". So maybe we can try to suspend our judgment until we've seen the action collapse few times.

Â 
Another benefit from this perspective to quiet down those doubtful voices in our heads that tells us that we are not enough courageous, compassionate, good friends, etc. since we can be both loving and heartless (who doesn't love extremes) until we choose to observe our feelings or when people try to reach out to observe that trait in us.
Â 
So just like a quantum computer, give your first date a second chance ðŸ’›

Can you think of other ways quantum superposition can make us understand and connect with each other in a new perspective?
