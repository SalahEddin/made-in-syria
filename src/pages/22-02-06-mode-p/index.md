*This may be harsh, but it’s net positive:*

Time to cozy up, but maybe it’s time to mindlessly binge a series or listen to a podcast, maybe follow a predetermined path of passive learning. It seems that the need of creation in us is not in its prime, it may have always fluctuated to weak points or is collectively weak in humanity, and only landmarks of people hold up our population through our history. We even outsourced part of creation to God back in the day. But I don’t dwell, the future is bright and you gotta hang tight to that sailing mast that’s already gaining speed and will ask all hands on the deck of creation.

The reason people often think I’m an idealist and not an optimist is imo that I’m in an sense pragmatic, that may sound weird, but let me explain:

*What I assume goes through most people’s head [who took the time and had the privilege]* to think of* *the situation we're in like state of immigration, education, economics is that these situations based on their observations aren't so nice, and they feel the social need to improve it. How they go about the improvement usually goes along the lines of: The ideal is X, and the best way to move there is A, B and then C. If those steps don't map into the current political field, you're a radical, otherwise, you're a very progressive intellectual.

This approach is nice because:


- You already have a list of action items to carry out, and you can often move towards it relatively fast, normalised to the speed of the world of politics.
- You already have an ultimate resolve that what you’re doing is good to some extent, whether you make it sound like it or not.
- In the case that you can map the political playground directly to your ideals. People will celebrate you or at least consider you an intellectual.

But on the other hand,  this approach is tied to direct actions and personal emotions over collective emotions, this doesn’t mean you believe in a way or another that you know better and thus may:


- Get blinded in one direction as you age and become inflexible in your thoughts and can miss future opportunities because you analyse with tools you started holding at the *[slightly past]* moment.
- Fight temptations to create a sense of other-ism much faster, or feel hopeless in all of humanity because they’re dumbasses, that in turn will affect your resolve which is the main selling point of this cognition mode.
- Lower sense of empathy to your political enemies, this is mostly unjustified [like the rest of this article].

Now this doesn’t seem so bad, does it? fair enough, and I'm not here about to present a better option per se, just another framework, better explained with a metaphor [*kind of*]:

You’re climbing a mountain, you know you need to head to the top, you can follow the process A of eyeing the next clip and internalising the end hold, and going hold by hold. 

But you can follow another mode P where instead of constantly looking at the current and final clips, you pick two dots on the horizon; one in the near proximity upwards of you, and one much further ahead, can even lie past the top of the mountain sometimes, while constantly glimpsing quickly at the nearest clip.

If you’re a climber or a sharp enough a person you realise that mode A is the most practical and the one actually employed by climbers. 

I may have used this metaphor to set you up for failure, because mapping the mountain we’re scaling fails to account for a constantly changing set of unique futures we’re creating in the political playground. *I also never said I was good at metaphors.*** **But accounting for that, it's easy to see now that it can be counter effective to scale the mountain without keeping track of the changing mountain top.

Maybe I’m better with examples than metaphors, so let’s take the hippies movement for one; at the time, scaling the mountain of human progress by finding new ways of living was remarkable, a breath of fresh air, and showed a new summit that the privileged could clearly see the value in. What is now is also clear in retrospect, is that this movement made a snapshot of its summit and started scaling. But slowly, with the rise of new tops like technology and a better understanding of our geopolitics, the inflexibility in the hippies movement was becoming clear very quickly, and although it tried with a second wind using the new-age community, a bit of a sharp sight reveals the same underlying mechanism.

Two consideration worth mentioning is that (1) This is not to say the movement had no benefits, as a child of thought in mode A *(let’s call them that for the sake of clarity in this post)*, it resulted in fast action and mass adoption. But it also was followed in dissipation, and a rising sense of other-ism that is very clearly present, you can sense it even today talking to old hippies, even in the minuscule sense of detachment people of this group show. (2) While some goals were mystical, you may be tempted to comment that these mountain summits were also shifting, but the insistence on certain rules to achieve spirituality by virtue of detachment were somewhat dogmatic.

On the other hand, social movements focusing on the processes tend to last longer, but gain traction much much slower; not only in the timeline sense, but the embedded rituals it incorporates in us as a society. This can be good because, it means it’ll give capitalism a harder time to co-opt it.

Partly, we can see glimpses of this with Extinction Rebellion, regardless of their methods and ideology, the mentality of demanding a better future through the means of realising the current truth and building their actions based on that, resembles mode P that relies on grasping a vague snapshot of the moment since the notion of truth embeds change, and that leaves the movement eyeing with a soft focus into the future but with a collection of current facts just to propel them forward from where we currently stand as a society, from the Amazon Forest current size, the last decision from COP each year or the politics of electric cars.

XR clearly doesn’t enjoy the benefits of type A movements; the ultimate resolve is replaced with an emotional check-in at the beginning of each meeting, they clearly do not fit into a single party on the playground, thus the mass adoption comes from people who mainly aren’t afraid to be outside the available *safe* options, and that removes the support from the silent majority™.

XR movement shares similarities with how my head processes the world around me, what differs is that my ideal is stemming from an emotional endpoint (e.g. empathy). But shares the following with soft focus, and then taking a snapshot of the current world, and finally realising the present to see what futures can be possibly produced from where we stand now. 

This approach has the disadvantages of:


- People may not take you seriously because you “change your mind” often and your outlook on previous movements can differ day by day. Though that relates to the political day you’re living in when asked about a topic.
- When coerced into a reduced opinion that fits within the political playfield, it's always so lacking, and people will hammer you with pre-templated arguments. This can cause you to choose to get tired, and focus on the small-scale changes you can make while avoiding these criticisms, other options are to be explored…

But this approach has the advantage of that: **you’ll have a positive outlook on life! and no matter what your society’s rut is, you’ll see the tools it has and adjust the summit you look into.** Even, in the most dystopian of situation you'll be able to never give up, because you strongly believe that you can't claim that you know better.

In a way we already follow this in progressive politics for actions, but never for ideals, we don’t have a political party that stands for ‘we don’t know! vote for us please’.

You may say, this mode ends up looking pretty much like mode A in its process but with a different description. That means I didn’t do a good job of explaining myself, plus I missed an important ritual; when trying to learn of an idea, I do my best to hear from someone’s mouth first and without challenging it, just learning about it, critical examination will follow, but not now. This will push you a bit further than an armchair intellectual into humanity; my first impression of an idea will almost always be tied into an empathetical memory, and even if your second visit to the idea with literature, arguments and critical mind results in the idea being incompatible or non-sensical. If you miss the second step, you’re unfortunately a part of the empathetic pest that our social media thrives on, although I love you, but you upset me a bit because your role fits into the systematic destruction of valid decision making. Plus, it’s really not that fulfilling to the ego, which makes one feel even more defensive to recognise faults in ideas.

Right now, I want to see a future where we create differently, and it’s not just about the motive and emotions. Seeing where we are, we have new tools we didn’t have before and that’s thanks partially to capitalism, I strongly believe in the effect late capitalism has on us, but this is more than victimising and helplessness, it’s about discovering a mode we didn’t get into yet but we can.

Please go create something, we can never destruct capitalism, but we can grow out of it and push it aside.
